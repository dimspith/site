Welcome to my blog!
<!-- more -->

One of the reasons I created a personal website and a blog was to
share my ideas and talk about various interesting topics that pop up
in my mind.

I will mainly be writing about programming, Open Source Software, or
just random interesting pieces of info that I want to share.

#### So how was this website made?

Part of the process of building your website is finding the ideal
software stack and a provider to host it.

I wanted a simple site, with minimal Javascript, or preferably, none,
and for it to be **fast**. So I rented a VPS and started tinkering.

The resulting stack is:

- [Zola](https://getzola.org) Static Site Generator.
- [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) CSS framework.
- [Umami](https://umami.is/) for privacy respecting analytics.

Since most people block analytics (including me) and don't want to be
tracked, Umami was a good choice since it's non-invasive, doesn't need
any cookies to function and can be easily blocked. I even went a step
further and opened up the collected data for all to see
[here](https://an.dimspith.com/share/hCXZ15fI/dimspith.com).

Although the website is not yet complete, I have lots of ideas on how
to extend it and a couple of blog posts in mind for the future.
